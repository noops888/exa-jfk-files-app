## 🎯 What is JFK Files Chat App?

The JFK Files Chat App is a free and opensource chat tool that lets you ask questions about the JFK assassination files that were just made public. It uses Exa to search through these files and an AI to help explain them in a way that's easy to understand.

Ask questions about the JFK files and receive responses backed by official documents from the National Archives.
